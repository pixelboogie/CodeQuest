# Code Quest

## Description
Code Quest is a project developed as part of the Coursera course for the ".NET FullStack Developer Specialization" certification. The project focuses on building an ASP.NET Web API. Throughout this project, you'll learn and implement the basics of RESTful web services and the HTTP protocol. The project also covers the design and implementation of a web API using the ASP.NET framework. Key topics include using attributes to define API endpoints, mapping HTTP requests to controller methods, and serializing and deserializing data using JSON and XML formats in web APIs.
